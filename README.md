Overview:

This is a Developement project for analyzing the National stock Exchange (NSE).

The Idea of the project on the big picture is to have a historical data in the database at our disposal, on which we can run any time of analysis.
Phase I:
In this project the phase 1 is one can download the 'Combined Open Interest across Exchange' file on demand

For those who have known these files are monthly summary reports of different exchange rates. 

This cli-app downloads data on demand - (The idea is to have it run daily on batch which I am working on at the moment) 

And stores the data to Postgres database.

The Idea is to grow the database upto years and we can stay upto date on running some predictive analytics on them.
